## üßë‚Äçüíº Admin Panel ‚Äì Final Feature Set for Intellix

The Admin Panel is the control center of the Intellix platform. It empowers academic administrators to manage users, academic sessions, courses, and performance analytics efficiently. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of its functionalities:

---

### 1. **Role-Based Access & User Profile Management**

* Admin can **create new user profiles** for students and teachers by entering:

  * Full Name
  * Profile Picture
  * Contact Information (Phone, Email)
  * Address
  * Admission Date or Join Date
* On submission, the system **automatically generates a unique Student/Teacher ID**, along with a system-generated **username and password** for login.
* These IDs will be used as tracking references for academic enrollment, teaching assignments, and performance records.
* Admin can view and manage login credentials securely and reset them if necessary.

---

### 2. **Course Assignment & Enrollment Management**

* For a selected academic session or semester:

  * Admin can **assign teachers to courses** using their IDs.
  * Admin can **view all enrolled students** in a course.
  * Admin manually **adds students to specific courses** by selecting from available student IDs.
* The system does not rely on date-based automation (since it runs locally), so **all academic transitions are performed manually** by the admin.
* An **AI Assistant button** will be present to auto-fill these operations:

  * Admin types a prompt like *"Assign student IDs 101, 102, 103 to course CSE302"*
  * The system simulates filling the form (checkboxes, course names) but leaves the admin to review and confirm before final submission.
  * This feature will also apply to assigning multiple courses to a teacher via AI input.

---

### 3. **Course Management System**

* Admin can:

  * Create, update, or delete **courses** with:

    * Course Code
    * Course Name
    * Credit Hours
    * Max Student Capacity
  * A bulk import option will allow admin to upload a list of all courses from CSV.
  * Admin can enroll students in bulk to a course by entering multiple student IDs.
  * A similar bulk option exists for assigning teachers to multiple courses.

---

### 4. **AI-Powered Academic Risk Alerts**

* The system evaluates student performance across three standard evaluation categories:

  * **Midterm** (30 marks)
  * **Assignments** (20 marks)
  * **Final Exam** (50 marks)
* If a student's combined score (before the final) falls near or below the **passing threshold of 40**, the AI will:

  * Display an alert on their dashboard
  * Notify them of the **minimum score needed in the final to pass**
  * Suggest study strategies or course repetition in worst-case scenarios

---

### 5. **Academic Calendar & Routine Planning**

* Admin can create:

  * **Class routines** in tabular formats with mappings of:

    * Courses
    * Teachers assigned
    * Seat capacity
    * Class timings
  * **Exam routines** similarly, including room numbers and student groups
* Though not dynamic (due to lack of real-time clocking), this module will be manually managed for each session and downloadable.

---

### 6. **Dashboard Analytics & Metrics Overview**

* Admin homepage will display real-time:

  * Total number of students, teachers, and active courses
  * Performance stats like average GPA, dropout predictions, and risk alerts
  * Chart visualizations for institutional metrics (e.g., grade distribution, course load by teacher)
  * Widgets styled in soft shadow cards (Poppins font-based UI, per visual reference)

---

### 7. **Bulk Data Operations & Sync Utilities**

* Import/export functionality for:

  * Student and teacher profiles
  * Course lists
  * Attendance and grades
* Bulk upload via CSV or manual multi-entry forms

---

### 8. **(Optional) Access Logs & Security** *(Not required for localhost version)*

* This feature is not mandatory and will be excluded to simplify development for a localhost environment.

---

### 9. **AI Integration Panel** ‚Äì üåü *Very Important*

* This module acts as the AI Control Center for the admin:

  * Manually initiate GPA prediction jobs for departments or batches
  * Auto-generate study plans based on performance analytics
  * View logs of how the AI is interacting with student data
  * Provide prompts for the AI to generate insights or recommendations
* Backend AI logic will be linked via internal FastAPI endpoints
